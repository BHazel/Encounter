Encounter
=========

Encounter is a simple program for calculating the interaction energy between two molecules using the output from a GAUSSIAN two-component counterpoise correction calculation.

The Counterpoise Correction arises due to the Basis Set Superposition Error in quantum modeling.

Build & Usage
-------------

Encounter comes in 4 different languages:

* C++/Qt (Encounter)
* Java (JCounterpoise)
* .NET/C# (Sharpen)
* Objective-C/Cocoa (Xen)

All source code can be found in the _1.0-northcote_ directory.
